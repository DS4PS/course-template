# Introduction to Data Science 

This unit defines the concept of "data science" and provides an overview of the course schedule for the semester. 

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this unit, you will:
* Be able to define data science and provide examples of use in the public sector.
* Create your first R Markdown document.

## What is Data Science?

> A data scientist is a person who should be able to leverage existing data sources, and create new ones as needed in order to extract meaningful information and actionable insights. These insights can be used to drive business decisions and changes intended to achieve business goals... ‘The Perfect Data Scientist’ is the individual who is equally strong in business, programming, statistics, and communication.

> Universities can hardly turn out data scientists fast enough. To meet demand from employers, the United States will need to increase the number of graduates with skills handling large amounts of data by as much as 60 percent.

> “Data Scientists identify complex business problems whilst leveraging data value. They work as part of a multidisciplinary team with data architects, data engineers, analysts and others.”
